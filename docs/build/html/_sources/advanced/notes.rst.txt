Date formats
**************************

Dates can be entered in regular "dd/mm/yyyy" format or in UTC format, either "yyyy-mm-dd" or 
"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss" or "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ", according to norm 
`ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_. The difference between the latter two formats
is that the first represents local time and the second UTC time. The norm allows you to specify
hours respective to UTC by adding or subtracting. This particular format is not allowed in *obsinfo*. 
Separators can be either "/" or "-". 

Dates in other formats will result in an exception. 

No effort is made to validate if dates are legal, i.e., to reject dates such as "31/02/2021".
