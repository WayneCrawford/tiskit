Basic - one level

Here is an example of a valid information file containing only
required fields, all in one file.  To save space, this is a one-channel
instrument.  Generally, to save space and avoid repetition, information files
are split into parts connected by JSON references: you can find the exact
same information as below, but spit into "atomic" files, here.

The file below can be found in obsinfo/_examples/examples/BASIC_FLAT.network.yaml
